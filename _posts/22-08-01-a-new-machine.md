> You have to make the back of the fence that people won’t see look just as beautiful as the front, just like a great carpenter would make the back of a chest of drawers … Even though others won’t see it, you will know it’s there, and that will make you more proud of your design. - Steve Jobs

I've built a lot of computers. I've made them professionally since the mid 80's and they have always delighted me when they run. Some og us put lots of bling on our machines, because we are proud of them, we are building ideas and new things inside them.

Our computers, or computing devices of today are usually general purpose machines that can be reconfigured in infinite ways. How are we to understand not just how the parts work, but what they will mean when they are assembled in various different ways to achieve vastly different goals?

Making everything work on a single machine today is similar to having a single piece of software that does everything. We have outgrown its usefulness and require something more. Something modular and composable... A [Composable Information Machine](/doc/cim)

A user is a person who utilizes a computer or network service. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing))

There are several problems with this definition. Specifically, it's not always a [person](/library/person).

I will denote this as a `classic definition` meaning, that is what the industry calls it, but for it is not a definition I want to carry forward.

Language specifically designed to write algorithms for computing.

Consider these paths:

## [Open Source](https://opensource.org/)
 - [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
 - [Python](https://python.org)
 
## [Dot Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)
 - [F#]
 - [C#]
 - [Visual Basic]
 
## [Web Oriented](https://www.znetlive.com/blog/web-2-0/)
 - [JavaScript]
 - [TypeScript]
 - [Purescript]

There are many paths, we don't have to stay on the same path, and we can choose multiple paths.

To get us started, we use [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

# devcontainer

This is a term [coined by Microsoft](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/developer-experience/devcontainers/) 
for running development environments inside [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) and [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/containers/overview). 
It is now a [standard](https://github.com/devcontainers/), 
used widely to contain the [limits](/library/limits), [boundaries](/library/boundary) 
and [initial state](/library/initial-state) of a development system. 

There are thousands of [premade containers](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-dev-containers), ready for use and testing and most 
for production level IT Environments. [Github](https://github.com) has the ability to run them as [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/introduction-to-dev-containers)

# Convergence

Different systems that move towards performing similar tasks. This concept moves tasks previously performed by separate systems into a single system that performs them all. Voice, video, and data were previously transmitted by different systems but now are transmitted over the same communication protocols. We have moved mostly from analog to digital and digital information is now converging into something distinct.

As Chief Scientist at Amaranthos, he has brought a new understanding of how to relate information in provable and distributed ways.
He is the creator of the [Composable Information Machine](/library/cim).

He started professionally developing software in 1982.  Software development has not only been his primary source of income since; it is his passion.  Many of his software development processes grew to fruition by seeing a business or consumer need and working diligently to fulfill that need with a real application.  When you love to do something it invades every aspect of your life.  

In recent years he has focused on improving the software development process, design patterns and application reach.  Learning from his own process failures as well as successes let him demonstrate how to achieve better real-world delivery of applications to companies ranging from "mom and pop" stores to top tier Computer Manufacturing,  Insurance Carriers,  Airlines and Government.

He has always maintained a passion for taking that knowledge back to the community by speaking and sharing often with local user groups.

He is also a 10 year veteran [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/32249)

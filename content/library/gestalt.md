Something that is made of many parts and yet is somehow more than or different from the combination of its parts. - [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gestalt)

This idea is that we build things and patterns emerge that did not forsee.
It is an analysis of patterns that form through [emergence](/library/emergence). We want to see new ideas emerge from old patterns.

> "The Gestalt laws of perceptual organization present a set of principles for understanding some of the ways in which perception works. Research continues to offer insights into perception and how we see the world. These principles of organization play a role in perception, but it is also important to remember that they can sometimes lead to incorrect perceptions of the world." - [Kendra Cherry](https://www.verywellmind.com/gestalt-laws-of-perceptual-organization-2795835)

We consider the process of learning to be ‘gestalt’ – `an Organised Whole`. The basic idea is that a thing cannot be understood by study of its constituent parts but only by the study of it as a totality or whole. This includes understanding the [behaviors](/library/behaviors), [limits](/library/limits), and [boundaries](/library/boundaries).

Insight is an intelligent search for problem solving. In this type of learning, when faced with a problematic situation, the process of discrimination and generalisation projects into `insight` or `clues` to solve the problem, sometimes by simply pointing at the answer.

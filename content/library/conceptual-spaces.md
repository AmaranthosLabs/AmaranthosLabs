Within cognitive science, two approaches currently dominate the problem of modeling representations. The symbolic approach views cognition as computation involving symbolic manipulation. Connectionism, a special case of associationism, models associations using artificial neuron networks. Peter GÃ¤rdenfors offers his theory of conceptual representations as a bridge between the symbolic and connectionist approaches.

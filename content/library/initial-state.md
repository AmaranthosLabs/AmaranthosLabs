The starting position for a [Composable Information Machine](/library/cim). This state may take running scripts or doing setup manually, then the machine become self-regulatory.

A known state of our environment from which all changes are tracked. The `initial state` must be constructed from and be reproducable with a known methodology. After such initial state is achieved, the [[Event Store]] may be used to recreate any state at any given position in the sequence of the machine.

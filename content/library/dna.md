From Biology = dioxyribonucleic acid, the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms.

Nearly every cell in the human body has the same DNA. Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus. It can replicate, or make copies of itself. Each strand of DNA in the double helix can serve as a pattern for duplicating the sequence of bases. This is critical when cells divide because each new cell needs to have an exact copy of the DNA present in the old cell.

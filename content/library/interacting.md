Decide how to interact with information. While there is no advance knowledge needed, we use:
 
 - [Information Theory](/library/information-theory)
 - [Category Theory](/library/category-theory)
 - [Applied Category Theory](/library/applied-category-theory)
 - [Algebraic Structures](/library/algebraic-structures)
 - [Algebraic Data Types](/library/algebraic-data-types)
 - [Function Reactive Programming](/library/frp)
 - [Geometric Algebra](/library/geometric-algebra)
 - [Compositional Game Theory](/library/compositional-game-theory)
 - [Conceptual Spaces](/library/conceptual-spaces)

and other specialized areas to improve our interaction with knowledge.

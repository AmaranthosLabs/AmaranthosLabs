[Algebraic Structures](https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2019/algebraic-structures-what-i-wish-someone-had-explained-about-functional-programming/)

In functional programming we have specific terms:
 - [Monoid](/library/monoid)
 - [Functor](/library/functor)
 - [Monad](/library/monad)
 - [Maybe](/library/maybe)
 - [Either](/library/either)
 - [Effect](/library/effect)

 These as a collective whole are Algebraic Structures, those rooted in pure mathematics.

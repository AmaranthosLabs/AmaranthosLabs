A novel property of a system or an entity that arises when that system or entity has reached a certain level of complexity and that, even though it exists only insofar as the system or entity exists, it is distinct from the properties of the parts of the system from which it emerges.

We want to discover and abstract these as unique and valuable ideas in our [cim](/library/cim).

In terms of us as individuals, they are the rules we have learned over time to use to make decisions. Some of these rules are beneficial. Others hold us back. We want to see these as processes we control for information and information correlation.

In the object-oriented programming paradigm, object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures; in particular in class-based variations of the paradigm it refers to a particular instance of a class.

In the relational model of database management, an object can be a table or column, or an association between data and a database entity (such as relating a person's age to a specific person).

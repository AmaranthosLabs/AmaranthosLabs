When you send a message to a friend over Facebook, WhatsApp, Discord, or most other messaging services, the message is relayed from you, the client, to a central server. The central server then routes the message to a second client: your friend. Very broadly, the client requests services, and the server fulfills them. This is called the client-server model. The client-server model is extremely common and is utilized by most of the online services you’re familiar with — everything from Netflix and Facebook to World of Warcraft. All of your data is stored by a third party, and you rely on them to completely. You have no way to verify that they’re handling your data responsibly, and you have to trust that they’ll continue to allow you to use their service.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) services eliminate those problems. It is possible for computers to exchange information directly and completely skip the middleman. Instead of a client delivering a message to a server to relay to a second client, the clients just transmit data between themselves. In P2P messaging apps, each participant effectively functions as both a client and a server simultaneously.

Domain is a scope of where and how one works. The space of the problem for which we are acting: the [limits](/library/limits), the [boundaries](/library/boundaries], and the [behaviors](/library/behaviors).

Unique Domains are essential, it's your own way of doing things, the business differential, the brand. These are your unique insights that make your business process different and helpful to you.

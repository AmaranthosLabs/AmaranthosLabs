> In programming languages, a type system is a logical system comprising a set of rules that assigns a property called a type to the various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions or modules. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system)

A collection of [limits](limit) and boundaries we will use to create a workflow around a collection of categories. As humans, we are pattern matching machines, we categorize, collect and sort naturally in our mind.

I want an aggregated abstraction that lets me reason about things in very broad terms. Something like account or organization or myself. How do I reason about all the relationships between these things with certainty, with the power to evolve, replicate and emerge clear understanding we have not had before. What is the shape of this thing?

We have traditionally used databases for this, and for the most part, we still will. However, I will have dozens of them, and they will keep growing. With most databases, I lose intent, it's just current state data.

With a Type system, I can stop guessing about how things in my system will act, because I have already put a set of limits and boundaries around how they are allowed to act.

We don't need to formalize this to start, nor do we need to prove the system, that should be a goal in the future. We need a base with which to create reason and information that will be stored over a very long period of time, think in decades at a minimum.

[Raspberry Pi](raspberry-pi), a.k.a. SoC or System on a chip. This is a minimal computing device frequently used for experimentation.

We can start our system on one of these, and scale it to bigger and better machinery as we go.

I intend to start with a most basic system, a stock [Raspberry Pi 4B](raspberry-pi). We will use an [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi) image since it is simplest for our initial needs. We will install a very basic operating system and docker to hold one specific program = [NetBox](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/). We will also be using [n8n](https://n8n.io) and have some other choices to make.

The idea is that we are building an infrastructure and we plan to store and maintain it for a long time.
